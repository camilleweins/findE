//Write a C++ program that will calculate the value of “e” (Euler’s number, e = 2.71828…) using a function you create named “find_e”. It shall have no arguments and return no values using the return statement. All transfer of information to and from the function must be in the form of global variable(s) which must be declared in your header file. The function “find_e” must be contained in a file separate file from the file containing the “main” function. You must ask the user for an accuracy value as you did in the previous program that calculated the value of pi. All output must be from the main program.

#include <iostream>

void find_e(){
    
}
